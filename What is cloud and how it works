What is cloud and how it works

Cloud computing is a on demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud service platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing model.

Why we called cloud only: cloud is mixture of different-different gases and water but in the end we desired output as a rain same thing we can use these resources whatever our desired suppose we required database, suppose we required servers we can get through cloud.

Characteristics of cloud
1.On demand self-service. (Whenever required we can access)
2.Broad Network access. (we can access our resource but we required Internet only)
3.Scalability. (Scale up and scale down servers as per requirements)
4.Resource pooling. (all resources are available we need to just pull and use)
5.Measured services. (everything calculated in the background)
